# Seattle Free Events Agent

## Overview
The Seattle Free Events Agent is a Python-based tool designed to **aggregate and extract information about free events happening in Seattle**. It automates the collection of event data, validates it, and prepares it for further use, such as displaying in a website, app, or calendar.

The project is built to be modular, maintainable, and secure, with sensitive information (like API keys) kept out of the repository using a `.gitignore` file.

## Features
- Scrapes or pulls event data from multiple sources.
- Extracts key event information:
  - Title
  - Date
  - Time
  - Location
  - URL
- Validates data to ensure completeness and consistency.
- Supports integration with automation pipelines or chatbots.
- Keeps API keys and sensitive data secure by ignoring `.env` in version control.
